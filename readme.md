## SETUP

To install the Multiscale Transforms for Signals on Graphs (MTSG) Toolbox, run
`MTSG_Path.m` to add the toolbox files to Matlab's path.  **NOTE:** you must
run `MTSG_Path.m` prior to loading any `GraphSig`, `GraphPart`, or `BasisSpec`
objects.



## GETTING STARTED

Run `ArticleFigures.m` as a demonstration of what this toolbox is used for.  
This script generates selected figures from the following articles:

1. J. Irion and N. Saito, *Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transforms*,
Japan SIAM Letters, vol. 6, pp. 21-24, 2014.

2. J. Irion and N. Saito, *The Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform*, Proc. 2014
IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing, pp. 472-475, 2014.

3. J. Irion and N. Saito, *Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis on
Graphs and Networks*, Wavelets and Sparsity XVI, (M. Papadakis, V. K. Goyal, D.
Van De Ville, eds.), Proc. SPIE 9597, Paper #95971F, Invited paper, 2015.

4. J. Irion and N. Saito, *Efficient Approximation and Denoising of Graph
Signals Using the Multiscale Basis Dictionaries*, to appear in IEEE Transactions
on Signal and Information Processing over Networks, 2017.

You can also run `DissertationFigures.m`, which reproduces nearly all of the
figures from my dissertation: *Multiscale Transforms for Signals on Graphs:
Methods and Applications*.
