SETUP

To install the Multiscale Transforms for Signals on Graphs (MTSG) Toolbox, run
MTSG_Path.m to add the toolbox files to Matlab's path.  NOTE: you must run
MTSG_Path.m prior to loading any GraphSig, GraphPart, or BasisSpec objects.



GETTING STARTED

Run ArticleFigures.m as a demonstration of what this toolbox is used for.  This
script generates selected figures from the following articles:
