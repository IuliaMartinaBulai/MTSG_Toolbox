SETUP

To install the Multiscale Transforms for Signals on Graphs (MTSG) Toolbox, run MTSG_Path.m to add the toolbox files to Matlab's path.  



GETTING STARTED

As a simple demonstration of the features contained in this toolbox, run demo.m.  After running it once, you may wish to use the code from sections 1.1. and onward on a more elaborate graph than P6 (the path graph of length 6).  

After running demo.m, you may wish to run ArticleFigures.m as a further demonstration of what this toolbox is used for.  This script generates selected figures from the two articles that describe the transforms featured in this toolbox:


1. J. Irion and N. Saito, "Hierarchical graph Laplacian eigen transforms," Japan SIAM Letters, vol. 6, pp. 21-24, 2014.

2. J. Irion and N. Saito, "The generalized Haar-Walsh transform," Proc. 2014 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop, pp. 488-491, 2014.
